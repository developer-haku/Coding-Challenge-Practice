# Coding-Challenge-Practice

Stores Personal Solutions for Coding Challenges.

> - :warning: You may find answers to some coding problems here, but solving it on your own is more fun, isn't it?
> - :warning: Not every solution is the best algorithm to solve the according problem. Some of them solve the problem in a brute force way, there are better solutions, you can find them on other places, or code one youself. DON'T EXPECT to find the best runtime and memory efficiency algorithm here.
